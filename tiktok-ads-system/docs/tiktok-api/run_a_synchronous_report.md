# Run a synchronous report

**Doc ID**: 1740302848100353
**Path**: API Reference/Reporting/Run a synchronous report

---

Use this endpoint to create a synchronous report task. 

This endpoint can currently return the reporting data of up to 20,000 advertisements. If your number of advertisements exceeds 20,000, please use `campaign_ids` / `adgroup_ids` / `ad_ids` as a filter to obtain the reporting data of all advertisements in batches. If you use `campaign_ids` / `adgroup_ids` / `ad_ids` as a filter, you can pass in up to 100 IDs at a time.

- To learn about how to run a synchronous report, see [Run a synchronous report](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738864778664961). 
- To find out the supported dimensions, metrics, and use cases for different report types, see [Report types](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738864835805186). 
- To learn about the relationship between advertising service type, report type and report data level, see [Overview-Data level](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1751087777884161&rid=h0qg6e2ivzd).
- To find out answers to common questions regarding reporting, see [FAQ](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738864850353154).

>**Note**

>If you compare the synchronous report with a report downloaded from TTAM (TikTok Ads Manager）, you will discover data inconsistency because the downloaded report should be compared with its counterpart, an asynchronous report, rather than a synchronous report. Both the TTAM downloaded report and the API asynchronous report do not implement the 20,000-truncation for ads.

## Request

**Endpoint** 

**Method** GET

**Header**

```xtable
| Field {25%} | Data Type{15%} | Description {60%}|
|---|---|---|
|Access-Token {Required}|string|Authorized access token. For details, see [Authentication](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738373164380162).|
```

**Parameters**

```xtable
| Field {25%} | Data Type{15%} | Description {60%}|
|---|---|---|
| advertiser_id {+Conditional} | string | You need to pass in either `advertiser_id`/`advertiser_ids` or `bc_id`.
- When `report_type` is set to `BASIC` or `AUDIENCE`, pass in `advertiser_id` or `advertiser_ids`. If you pass in both `advertiser_id` and `advertiser_ids`, `advertiser_id` will be ignored.
- When `report_type` is set to `PLAYABLE_MATERIAL`, `CATALOG`, or `TT_SHOP`, pass in `advertiser_id`.
- When `report_type` is set to `BC`, pass in `bc_id`.
Advertiser ID. |
|advertiser_ids {+conditional}| string[] |When `report_type` is set to `BASIC` or `AUDIENCE`, you need to pass in either `advertiser_id` or `advertiser_ids`. If you pass in both `advertiser_id` and `advertiser_ids`, `advertiser_id` will be ignored. 
Valid when `report_type` is `BASIC` or `AUDIENCE`.
 
 A list of advertiser IDs. 
 Max size: 5.  

Please be aware of the following information when working with this field: 
- When `advertiser_ids` is used, we will return up to 20,000 IDs in response. The cutoff logic for IDs is based on the creation time of campaigns, ad groups, or ads in descending order, but we cannot guarantee that each advertiser will have an evenly distributed number of IDs.
- When `advertiser_ids` is used, the returned metrics data in the response will include `currency`, `timezone`, and `advertiser_id`. 
- Different advertisers might have different time zones. You can use `multi_adv_report_in_utc_time` to determine whether the data returned should be set to the UTC+0 timezone for all advertisers or set to the local timezone for each respective advertiser. 
- Different advertisers might have different currencies, and we will return the corresponding currency for each advertiser in the returned `metrics`. These metric data will be presented without a decimal point. For instance, a spend of "100 USD" will be displayed as 100 without any decimal indicator such as ".000".
- If you want to view the total added-up metrics for all advertiser IDs, enable `enable_total_metrics` in your request. The returned `total_metrics` in the response will include `currency`, `timezone`, and `advertiser_id`, but all with a value of `-`.
**Note**:
- If you use `advertiser_ids` but do not include any ID dimensions in the dimensions field, we will return `0` as the value for `currency`, `timezone`, and `advertiser_id` and `-` as the value of **cost-related** metrics, such as `spend`, in the `metrics` object of the response.
- The advertisers specified in `advertiser_ids` should all belong to the same TikTok for Business user. Otherwise, an error will occur. Use [/oauth2/advertiser/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1738455508553729) to retrieve a list of advertiser IDs that belong to the same TikTok for Business user.|
| bc_id{+Conditional} | string | You need to pass in either `advertiser_id`/`advertiser_ids` or `bc_id`. When `report_type` is set to `BASIC` or `AUDIENCE`,, pass in `advertiser_id`or `advertiser_ids`.

- When `report_type` is `BASIC`, `AUDIENCE` or `CATALOG`:If you set this field to `AUCTION_CAMPAIGN`, the data for all ads under undeleted auction campaigns will be returned, because by default the `campaign_status` filter is applied and defaults to `STATUS_NOT_DELETE`.
