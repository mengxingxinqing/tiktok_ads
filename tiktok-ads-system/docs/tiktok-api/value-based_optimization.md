Value-Based optimization (VBO) is a method of delivering ads to people who have a potential for becoming a high value customer. It comprises an optimization goal called `VALUE`, which includes two distinct value types, and two bidding strategies. The two bidding strategies are configured via the `deep_bid_type` field.

## Value types (for App)
Once you have set the optimization goal as Value, you can choose from the following value types:
- **Purchase Value**

By selecting Purchase Value, also known as VBO IAP (Value-Based Optimization for in-app purchases), you can maximize your revenue from in-app purchases. This value type is designed to optimize your earnings by targeting users who are more likely to make valuable purchases within your app.
- **Ad Revenue Value**

Alternatively, you can choose Ad Revenue Value, also known as VBO IAA (Value-Based Optimization for in-app advertising). This value type prioritizes targeting users who are more likely to generate higher ad revenue, helping you maximize your earnings from in-app advertisements.

Note that the Value optimization goal is also supported for websites, allowing you to optimize for value-based outcomes on your website. However, the preceding value types are specific to app-based Value-Based Optimization.

By selecting the appropriate value type in VBO, you can align your advertising strategy with your specific revenue goals.

> **Note**
VBO IAP (Value-Based Optimization for in-app purchases) and VBO IAA (Value-Based Optimization for in-app advertising) in different scenarios are currently allowlist-only features.
