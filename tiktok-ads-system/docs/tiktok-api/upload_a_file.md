# Upload a file

**Doc ID**: 1737720893061122
**Path**: API Reference/Files/Upload a file

---

Use this endpoint to upload a file. The transfer speed is limited by your network bandwidth. The maximum size of a file that you can upload is 100 MB.

After you upload a file to TikTok’s file repository, a `file_id` will be returned in the response. You can use the `file_id` to retrieve the file in the repository and transfer it to the Asset Library.

>  **Note**

>  Once a file is uploaded to the file repository, it is kept for 24 hours, after which it will expire. If the file you want to use in your ads expires, you need to re-upload the file to the file repository.
