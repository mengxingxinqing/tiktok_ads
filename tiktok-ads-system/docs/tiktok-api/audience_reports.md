# Audience reports

Audience reports are a type of report from which you can get audience data, including age, gender, region, or interest.  

> **Notes**
- The data in audience reports is not real-time data. There is 10-12 hours of processing latency for audience data.
- Running audience reports in CHUNK mode (`query_mode`= `CHUNK`) is not supported. You can only run synchronous basic reports in CHUNK mode.
- We have optimized reporting performance for audience reports with the dimension of `behavior_id` via [/report/integrated/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1740302848100353) (without `order_field` and `enable_total_metrics` parameters). This optimization can increase the number of queried IDs to 2000. Please note that the first request may take a long time to generate responses. However, subsequent requests with the same query parameters but different page numbers can be returned quickly.

Currently, this optimization is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative. Once you are on the allowlist, there is no need to add a new request parameter, as we will automatically enable it in the downstream.
