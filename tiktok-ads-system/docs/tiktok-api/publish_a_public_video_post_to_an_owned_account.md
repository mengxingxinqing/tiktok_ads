# Publish a public video post to an owned account

**Doc ID**: 1762228496095234
**Path**: API Reference/Accounts/Posts/Publish a public video post to an owned account

---

Use this endpoint to publish a public video post to an owned TikTok Account.

You need to specify the video to be published, and optionally the video caption and whether to enable different forms of user engagement (comments/stitches/duets).  

To learn about the post publishing Webhook events that you can subscribe to, see [Post publishing events](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1810515090228226). To configure a Webhook callback URL for your developer app, use the Webhook API endpoint [/business/webhook/update/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1810521279479810). 

> **Note**

>  
- To promote authentic sharing and avoid spamming, TikTok limits the publishing of video posts per TikTok account via the endpoint to six video posts per minute with an upper limit of 15 per day.
- After publishing the video to your TikTok account, you might notice a decrease in resolution and bit rate compared to the original video file when viewing the post on your account profile or downloading it. This is a result of the video transcoding process, which can lead to variations in resolution and bit rate depending on factors such as the device's display capabilities and network conditions.

**Important**: 
- Starting from November 16th, 2023, you can no longer publish videos using unverified video URLs. To ensure a smooth API integration, we recommend you verify ownership of URL properties as soon as possible, and specify a URL that has been verified for ownership, either manually or automatically. 
 To manually verify ownership of a URL property, follow the steps outlined in [Manage URL properties](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1769324038780930).
- After November 16th, 2023, if you want to publish a test video through [/business/video/publish/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1762228496095234) using a test video URL that doesn't require verification, use the [test URL](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-va2/uvpapzpbxjH-aulauvJ-WV[[/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/3min.mp4) `https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-va2/uvpapzpbxjH-aulauvJ-WV[[/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/3min.mp4`.
- Note that if you are a developer or an advertiser who used the [/business/video/publish/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1762228496095234) endpoint to publish videos prior to April 7th, 2023, we have automatically set the corresponding domains of video URLs specified through the `video_url` parameter to the "verified" status. Therefore, we recommend that you use the [/business/property/list/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1769325368603650) endpoint to confirm whether the domains you utilize for hosting videos have been automatically verified. |

| post_info {Required} | object | Body | Information about the post.

This field is required, even if you don't want to use any of the additional parameters within `post_info`, including `caption`, `is_brand_organic`, `is_branded_content`, `disable_comment`, `disable_duet`, `disable_stitch`, `thumbnail_offset`, `is_ai_generated`, `upload_to_draft`, `tto_invite_link`, and `is_ads_only`. In such cases, set this field to an empty object (`{}`). |
#| caption | string |  | Video caption/description - which can contain #hashtags and @mentions of friends (mutual followers) of the owned TikTok Account.

  You can use "\n" as line break to display the video caption in multiple lines within the mobile TikTok App. However, for the line break to work effectively, the caption must contain enough characters to trigger truncation based on the current mobile phone's display settings and operating system. This truncation is characterized by an ellipsis mark (...) and the word "more", which users can click to expand and view the full caption. 
If the caption is too short and does not trigger truncation, the "\n" character will be ignored, and the caption will be displayed on a single line without any line breaks.
Note that  in the TikTok Web App "\n" will be ignored.

 Length limit: 2,200 characters (UTF-16 encoding), including a maximum of 30 mentions. 

**Example**: Me and me casa 🏠 #cat #kitten #britishshorthair
