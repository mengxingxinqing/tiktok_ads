# Upload a business certificate

**Doc ID**: 1739938996913218
**Path**: API Reference/BC Assets/Upload a business certificate

---

Use this endpoint to upload a business certificate. You need to be an Admin user of the Business Center. 

If you want to create an ad account in the Business Center for advertisers that are registered in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, France, Brazil, or Mexico, you need to upload images of business licenses or other qualification documents. 

This endpoint returns the ID of the uploaded image (`image_id`). This field can then be passed to the `license_image_id` (for ad accounts registered in the Chinese Mainland or Hong Kong) or `qualification_image_ids` (for ad accounts registered in France, Brazil, or Mexico) field in the [/bc/advertiser/create/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739939020318721) endpoint.

> **Important**

> As of September 26, 2024, to ensure ad account security, we have implemented UnionPay verification for the creation of ad accounts in Business Centers via [/bc/advertiser/create/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739939020318721) for advertisers registered in the Chinese mainland. Existing API workflows will continue to function until January 8, 2025. By mid-October 2024, we have released the API changes along with detailed API documentation supporting this change. Affected developers need to implement the new workflow before January 8, 2025, after which integrations might no longer function correctly.
