This article walks you through the steps to enable Value-Based Optimization (VBO) in Manual Campaigns.

# Prerequisites
- You've gained access to TikTok API for Business. See [Get Started - Step by step workflow](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1735713609895937&rid=7llhcla7zmh) for details. 
  - To enable VBO, you need relevant permissions. See [API Reference](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1735713875563521) to find out permissions required for endpoints (including the endpoints listed in the "Steps" section) and see [Update app permissions](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738855280338946&rid=7llhcla7zmh) to find out how to configure permissions.  
- VBO IAP (Value-Based Optimization for in-app purchases) and VBO IAA (Value-Based Optimization for in-app advertising) in different scenarios are currently allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative.
- Some VBO IAA and VBO IAP features are available after you meet the unlocking criteria. To find out the unlocking criteria, refer to the **"Unlocking criteria for VBO"** section below. To learn more about VBO IAP and VBO IAA, see [Value-Based Optimization - Value types](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739381743067137#item-link-Value%20types).
- Day 0 or day 7 bidding for VBO IAP in Advanced Dedicated Campaign or Android campaign scenarios are currently allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative.
- Day 0 or day 7 bidding for VBO IAA in Advanced Dedicated Campaign or Android campaign scenarios are currently allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative.
 
# Unlocking criteria for VBO
VBO will be automatically unlocked for the promoted App (`app_id`) or website (`pixel_id`) when the App or website meets the following unlocking criteria.

```xtable
| Promoted object {15%}| Unlocking criteria {35%}| Parameter {15%}| Requirement {35%}|
|---|---|---|
| App  (VBO IAP)| The criteria depend on the placement setting you want to use: 
-  To use Automatic Placement or non-Pangle-only Select Placement, the App needs to have at least **30 unique Purchase events with value attributed to TikTok or Global App Bundle placements over any consecutive 7 days. **
-  To use Pangle-only Select Placement, you need to first be allowlisted for VBO with Pangle-only placement. Then the App needs to have at least **50 unique Purchase events with value attributed to Pangle placement in its lifetime. ****Note**:
-  Once unlocked, VBO IAP will remain available to use for the app.
-  VBO with Pangle-only placement is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative.  | `app_id` | 
-  If you don't want to set `placements` to `PLACEMENT_PANGLE`, the App (`app_id`) needs to have at least 30 unique Purchase events (`optimization_event`= `ACTIVE_PAY`) , which are created with `value` specified in the `properties` object and attributed to TikTok or Global App Bundle placements over any consecutive 7 days. 
-  If you want to set `placements` to `PLACEMENT_PANGLE`, the App (`app_id`) needs to have at least 50 unique Purchase events (`optimization_event`= `ACTIVE_PAY`), which are created with `value` specified in the `properties` object and attributed to Pangle placement in its lifetime.  To check whether the App has accumulated enough events and is supported for a certain placement setting, pass `placements` and the App ID to [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753). If the App has accumulated enough events and is supported for the specified `placements`, the returned `vo_status` will be `QUALIFIED`. 
To report App Events for your App, use [/app/track/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740859196043266) or [/app/batch/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740859218541569). |
| App (VBO IAA) | To unlock VBO IAA for Automatic Placement, TikTok-only, or Pangle-only Select Placement, the App must meet the following requirements: 
-  The App is an Android App. 
-  The Mobile Measurement Partner for the App is AppsFlyer or Adjust.
-  The Ads impression ROAS for the App is greater than or equal to 1. 
**Note**: Once unlocked, VBO IAA will remain available to use for the app.  | `app_id` | To enable VBO IAA with `PLACEMENT_TYPE_AUTOMATIC`, `PLACEMENT_TIKTOK`, or `PLACEMENT_PANGLE`, the App (`app_id`) must meet the following requirements: 
-  The `platform` returned from [/app/info/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1740859272887297) for the App is `ANDROID`.
-  The `partner_name` returned from [/app/info/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1740859272887297)  for the App is `AppsFlyer` or `Adjust`.
-  The ** Ads impression ROAS** for the App meets or exceeds 1 during any previous time frame.  To confirm if the Ads impression ROAS requirement is met, you can use any of the following methods: **Method 1 (Recommended) **: Pass the `app_id` directly to [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753) to check whether the App is eligible for VBO IAA.
- **Method 2**: Run a synchronous basic report by using [/report/integrated/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1740302848100353). Set `query_lifetime` to `true`, and include the In-app event metric `total_ad_impression_roas` and the attribute metric `tt_app_id` in the request parameter `metrics`. The Ads impression ROAS (`total_ad_impression_roas`) for the App (`tt_app_id`) should be equal to or greater than 1.   |
| Website | The pixel needs to have at least **20 unique Complete Payment events with value and currency attributed to TikTok, Pangle, or Global App Bundle placements over any consecutive 7 days. **
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained **at least 20** unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and **another 20** attributed to Pangle, any placement is valid.  
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained **at least 20** unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and **less than 20** attributed to Pangle, only the TikTok placement is valid. 
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained **less than 20** unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and **more than 20 ** attributed to Pangle, only the Pangle placement is valid.  **Note**: Once unlocked, VBO will remain available to use for the pixel.| `pixel_id` | The pixel (`pixel_id`) needs to have at least 20 unique Complete Payment events (`optimization_event`= `SHOPPING`) , which are created with `value` and `currency` specified in the `properties` object and attributed to TikTok, Pangle, or Global App Bundle placements over any consecutive 7 days. 
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained at least 20 unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and another 20 attributed to Pangle, any configurations through `placement_type` and `placements` are supported.
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained at least 20 unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and less than 20 attributed to Pangle, you can only set `placements` to `PLACEMENT_TIKTOK`.
-  If the pixel, over any consecutive 7 days, obtained less than 20 unique attributed Complete Payment events with value attributed to TikTok, and more than 20 attributed to Pangle, you can only set `placements` to `PLACEMENT_PANGLE`.   To check whether the Pixel has accumulated enough events and is supported for a certain placement setting, pass `placements` and the Pixel ID to [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753). If the Pixel has accumulated enough events and is supported for the specified `placements`, the returned `vo_status` will be `QUALIFIED`. 
To report Pixel Events for your App, use [/pixel/track/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740858531237890) or [/pixel/batch/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740858565852225). |

# Steps
> **Note**

> Before enabling VBO, it is recommended to use [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753) to check whether your settings are eligible for VBO.

## Enable VBO for App
### IAP
#### For iOS apps

(/code)
```

2. Create an ad group using [/adgroup/create/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739499616346114). Note that the following requirements must be met.

```xtable
| Setting {20%} | Requirement {20%} | Parameter {25%} | How to configure the parameter {35%} |
|---|---|---|---|
| Promoted App | Set an Android App that is eligible for VBO IAP|
- `promotion_type`
- `app_id`
- `operating_systems`  |
- Set `promotion_type` to `APP_ANDROID`
- Set `app_id` to the ID of an Android App that is eligible for VBO IAP. 
You can get IDs of Android Apps from [/app/list/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740859313270786). For Android Apps, the returned `platform` will be `ANDROID`. 
 To check whether an App ID is eligible for VBO IAP, pass the App ID to the parameter `app_id` in [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753).
- Set `operating_systems` to `["ANDROID"]`  |
| Placement | Any of the following types: 
- **Automatic Placement**  
- **Select Placement** with TikTok placement or Pangle placement or both| `placement_type`
 `placements` | Any of the following configurations:
- Set `placement_type` to `PLACEMENT_TYPE_AUTOMATIC` 
- Set `placement_type` to `PLACEMENT_TYPE_NORMAL`, and only include `PLACEMENT_TIKTOK` or `PLACEMENT_PANGLE` or both in the value of `placements` |
| Optimization Goal | Value | `optimization_goal` | `VALUE` |
| Select value | Purchase value | `optimization_event` | `ACTIVE_PAY` |
| Deep Conversion Event | ROI of the purchase | `secondary_optimization_event` | `PURCHASE_ROI` |
| Bid Strategy | 
-  Highest Value (Highest Gross Revenue): To spend your budget fully and maximize the value of results
-  Minimum ROAS (Target ROAS): To keep your average ROAS around or higher than the target ROAS value | 
- `deep_bid_type` 
- `bid_type`| 
-  Set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS` or `VO_HIGHEST_VALUE`
**Note**: If you set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS`, pass in `roas_bid` at the same time.
-  Set `bid_type` to `BID_TYPE_NO_BID` |
| Time window of the bid strategy | Any of the following types:
- Day 7 ROAS or Highest Value 
- Day 0 ROAS or Highest Value  | `vbo_window` | Any of the following values: 
- `SEVEN_DAYS`
- `ZERO_DAY` For example, if you set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS`, pass in `roas_bid`, and set `vbo_window` to `ZERO_DAY`, the system will aim to keep your average ROAS of the current day around or higher than the target ROAS value.
 
**Note**: Day 0 or Day 7 bidding (`vbo_window` is `ZERO_DAY` or `SEVEN_DAYS`) for VBO IAP in Android campaign scenarios are currently allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative. |
| Billing event | oCPM | `billing_event` | `OCPM` |
| Delivery type | Standard | `pacing` | `PACING_MODE_SMOOTH` |

-  Minimum ROAS (Target ROAS): To keep your average ROAS around or higher than the target ROAS value  | 
    
- `deep_bid_type`
- `bid_type` | 
    
-  Set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS` or `VO_HIGHEST_VALUE`.
**Note**: If you set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS`, pass in `roas_bid` at the same time. The value range for `roas_bid` is 0.01-10.

    `SEVEN_DAYS` or `ZERO_DAY`

 For example, if you set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS`, pass in `roas_bid`, and set `vbo_window` to `ZERO_DAY`, the system will aim to keep your average ROAS of the current day around or higher than the target ROAS value. 

**Note**: Day 0 or Day 7 bidding (`vbo_window` is `ZERO_DAY` or `SEVEN_DAYS`) for VBO IAA in Android campaign scenarios are currently allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative. |

```xtable
| Setting {20%} | Requirement {25%} | Parameter {20%} | How to configure the parameter {35%} |
|---|---|---|---|
| Promoted Website | Set a pixel that is eligible for VBO | `promotion_type` | `WEBSITE` |
| Promoted Website | Set a pixel that is eligible for VBO | `pixel_id` | Specify the ID of a pixel that is eligible for VBO. 
To check whether a Pixel ID is eligible for VBO, pass the Pixel ID to the parameter `pixel_id` in [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753). 
 To get pixel IDs, you can use [/pixel/list/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740858697598978). |
| Optimization Goal | Any of the following options:
- Value: Spend your budget fully while maximizing purchase value, or keep your average return on ad spend (ROAS) around or higher than the target ROAS value
- Automatic Value Optimization: Dynamically optimize for the highest value or maximum delivery via machine learning.   | `optimization_goal` |Any of the following values: 
- `VALUE`
- `AUTOMATIC_VALUE_OPTIMIZATION`
**Note**: 
- Automatic Value Optimization is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative.
- Enabling Automatic Value Optimization and Campaign Budget Optimization at the same time is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative.  |
| Conversion Event | Complete Payment | `optimization_event` | `SHOPPING` |
| Bid Strategy |
- If Optimization Goal is set to Value, you can use any of the following options: Highest Value: To spend your budget fully while maximizing purchase value 
-  Minimum ROAS: To keep your average return on ad spend (ROAS) around or higher than the target ROAS value 
- If Optimization Goal is set to Automatic Value Optimization, you can only use Highest Value. | 
- `deep_bid_type`
- `bid_type`  | 
- If `optimization_goal` is set to `VALUE`, use the following settings:Set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS` or `VO_HIGHEST_VALUE`
**Note**: If you set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_MIN_ROAS`, pass in `roas_bid` at the same time.
-  Set `bid_type` to `BID_TYPE_NO_BID`
- If `optimization_goal` is `AUTOMATIC_VALUE_OPTIMIZATION`:`roas_bid` is not supported. 
- Set `deep_bid_type` to `VO_HIGHEST_VALUE` and `bid_type` to `BID_TYPE_NO_BID`.The fields `deep_bid_type` and `bid_type` can be omitted. If you omit these fields, `deep_bid_type` will default to `VO_HIGHEST_VALUE` and `bid_type` will default to `BID_TYPE_NO_BID`.|
| Billing event | oCPM | `billing_event` | `OCPM` |

## Enable VBO for Product Sales objective
To enable VBO for the Product Sales objective, you can use the [/tool/vbo_status/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1770016073586753) endpoint to check whether your settings are eligible for VBO. You need to specify `objective_type` as `PRODUCT_SALES` in the API request. If your settings are eligible, the returned `vo_status` will be `QUALIFIED`. Note that the specific settings required for enabling VBO for the Product Sales objective may vary depending on your use case.
