You can enhance your ads with any of the following three Premium Add-on types as interactive add-ons.
- A Pop-out Showcase consists of an image and a call-to-action text. It pops up after an ad plays for several seconds. 
- A Gesture consists of an image and a pop-up card. It invites the audience to tap or swipe on an ad in order to unveil rewards or more information. This is a strong invitation for the audience to interact since they get a payoff by physically engaging with the ad.
- Superlike consists of an image and a pop-up window. It engages the audience with a surprise visual element after they like a video ad. With Superlike, heart-shaped and customized icons float across the screen when the audience likes or double-taps on the ads.

# Use Pop-out Showcase
To use a Pop-out Showcase in your ad, you need to perform the following steps. 

## Prerequisites
Upload an image as the Premium Badge image using [/file/image/ad/upload/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739067433456642). The `image_id` in the response will be used to create a Pop-out Showcase portfolio. 

Ensure the image meets the following specification requirements:
  - Dimensions: 448 pixels in width and 448 pixels in height.
  - Image format: JPG, JPEG, PNG, or GIF.
  - File size: within 1 MB.
  
## Steps
1. Use [/creative/portfolio/create/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739091950439426) to create a Pop-out Showcase portfolio. 
- Set `creative_portfolio_type` to `PREMIUM_BADGE`.
- Pass in your image ID to the `image_id` field within the `badge_image_info` object.
- Specify the time when the premium badge starts to show via the `badge_show_time`, for example, 5 seconds. The first three seconds and the last five seconds of the video ad cannot be used as the badge start time.
- Set a call-to-action text via the `call_to_action_text` data field.
- Configure the relative coordinates of the top-left corner of the badge via the `badge_position` object. `position_x` is the x coordinate of the top-left corner divided by 720. `position_y` is the y coordinate of the top-left corner divided by 1280. 

This endpoint returns the ID of the portfolio (`creative_portfolio_id`) that has been created.
