# Update Smart Creative materials

**Doc ID**: 1739473077112833
**Path**: API Reference/Smart Creative/Update Smart Creative materials

---

Use this endpoint to modify Smart Creative ad creatives. You can modify call-to-action, ad names, images, and video materials. This is a totally new endpoint in v1.3.

This endpoint supports incremental updates. To modify an updateable setting, you can set `patch_update` to `true` and pass only the field to be updated and the required fields, including the Header parameters, `advertiser_id`, and `adgroup_id`.

> **Note**

>   If you want to update one or more parameters in an array type field, regardless of whether you set `patch_update` to `true`, you need to pass all original parameters from when you created the Smart Creative ad in that array type field, along with their updated values. If you only pass some parameters, it may result in errors or cause unspecified parameters to be overwritten with default values or null values. 
- For example, if you initially passed `tiktok_item_id`, `identity_id`, and `identity_type` in `media_info_list` when creating the ad, and you want to update only `tiktok_item_id`, you still need to pass all three fields (`tiktok_item_id`, `identity_id`, and `identity_type`) in `media_info_list`. The values for `identity_id` and `identity_type` should remain unchanged.
-  If you specified multiple creative materials in `media_info_list` when creating the ad, and you want to update only one creative material, you still need to provide information for all creative materials in `media_info_list`.
