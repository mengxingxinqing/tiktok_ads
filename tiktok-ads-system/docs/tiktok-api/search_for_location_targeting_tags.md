# Search for location targeting tags

**Doc ID**: 1761236883355649
**Path**: API Reference/Tools/Search for location targeting tags

---

Use this endpoint to search for location targeting tags by keyword. 

You can search for two types of targeting tags that are used to target ad audiences: zip code IDs (currently only supported for the US) or postal code IDs (Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam) and location IDs. Then to apply targeting tags to your ads, you can pass the returned zip code IDs or postal code IDs to `zipcode_ids` or location IDs to `location_ids` when calling [/adgroup/create/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739499616346114), [/adgroup/update/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739586761631745) or [/ad/audience_size/estimate/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1740302379236353).

Both [/tool/region/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1737189539571713) and `/tool/targeting/search/` can be used to get location IDs.

>**Note**

- This endpoint requires POST method, because for GET requests the length of URL will be limited. 
- Targeting postal code areas in Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative. 
- Targeting the newly available countries or regions (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Cyprus, Algeria, Estonia, Croatia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Lithuania, Latvia, Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Paraguay, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia) using the advertising objective `TRAFFIC`, `LEAD_GENERATION`, `APP_PROMOTION`, or `WEB_CONVERSIONS` and the TikTok placement are currently separate allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, contact your TikTok representative. You need to apply for a separate allowlist for each newly available country or region.
- Targeting the newly available countries or regions (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Cyprus, Algeria, Estonia, Croatia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Lithuania, Latvia, Puerto Rico, Paraguay, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia) using the advertising objective `REACH`, `VIDEO_VIEWS`, or `ENGAGEMENT` and the TikTik placement are currently separate allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, contact your TikTok representative. You need to apply for a separate allowlist for each newly available country or region.  When you target these countries or regions using the advertising objective `REACH`, `VIDEO_VIEWS`, or `ENGAGEMENT`, pre-bid third-party Brand Safety solutions are not supported. Therefore, you cannot set `brand_safety_type` to `THIRD_PARTY`.
