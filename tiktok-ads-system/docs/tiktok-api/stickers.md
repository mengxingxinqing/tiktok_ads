## Use Countdown Sticker
To use a Countdown Sticker in your ad, you need to perform the following steps. 
1. Use [/creative/portfolio/create/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739091950439426) to create a Countdown Sticker portfolio.
- Set `creative_portfolio_type` to `STICKER`.
- Pass the value `COUNTDOWN`, `REMINDER_COUNTDOWN` or `LIVE_REMINDER_COUNTDOWN` to the `sticker_type` field according to the type of sticker you want to create.
- Configure the basic settings of the sticker via `title`, `cutoff_time`, `color`, `display_angle`, `position_x`, `position_y` , `size` (or `predefined_placement` instead of `position_x`, `position_y` and `size`), and `opacity`.
- Configure the special settings for stickers with reminders (when `sticker_type` is not `COUNTDOWN`):
  - For LIVE stickers with reminder:  set `reminder_time`  as one minute, five minutes, or ten minutes after the LIVE event starts, and pass in `live_tiktok_user_id`.
  - For non-LIVE stickers with reminder: set `reminder_time`  as one minute, one hour, or one day before the non-LIVE event, and pass in `landing_page_url`.
  
  This endpoint returns the ID of the portfolio (`creative_portfolio_id`) that has been created. 
2.  Use the portfolio in your ad.
- For Upgraded Smart+ Ads: Pass the value of `creative_portfolio_id` to the `card_id` field when you use [/smart_plus/ad/create/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1843317390059522) or [/smart_plus/ad/update/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1843317411665921) to create or update your ad.
