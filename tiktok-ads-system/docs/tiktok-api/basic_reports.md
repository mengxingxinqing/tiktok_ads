# Lifetime supports
Basic reports support lifetime metrics at the Advertiser, Campaign, Ad group, and Ad levels.

Breakdown by time or location is not supported when querying for lifetime metrics, so when  `query_lifetime` = `True` , `dimensions` can not contain `stat_time_day`, `stat_time_hour` or `country_code`.
