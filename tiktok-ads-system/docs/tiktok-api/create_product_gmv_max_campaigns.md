# Prerequisites
- You've gained access to TikTok API for Business. See [Get Started - Step by step workflow](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1735713609895937) for details. 
  - To create Product GMV Max Campaigns, you need relevant permissions. See [API Reference](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1735713875563521) to find out permissions required for endpoints (including the endpoints listed in the "Steps" section) and see [Update app permissions](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738855280338946) to find out how to configure permissions.  
- Creating a GMV Max Campaign requires setting up a TikTok Shop in Business Center first. 
  1. Add the TikTok Shop to the Business Center. You can either [create a TikTok Shop in Seller Center](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/set-up-tiktok-shop-using-tiktok-seller-center) and [add a TikTok Shop to the Business Center as Shop admin](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/add-tiktok-shop-from-business-center) or[ request access to the others' TikTok Shop in Business Center](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/requesting-tiktok-shop-access-business-center).
  2. Ensure that you have admin permission for the Business Center. To do this, call [/bc/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1737115687501826). 
    - If the Business Center is not returned in the response, you are not a member of the Business Center. Ask one admin for the Business Center to invite you to join the Business Center as a member and grant admin access using [/bc/member/invite/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739939455765505).
    - If the returned `user_role` for the Business Center is `STANDARD`, you are a standard member of the Business Center. Ask one admin for the Business Center to update your permission for the Business Center to admin using [/bc/member/update/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739696704424961).
  3. Ensure that you have management access to the TikTok Shop that you want to use to create GMV Max Campaigns. To do this, call [/bc/asset/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739432717798401) and set `asset_type` to `TIKTOK_SHOP`. 

If the returned `store_role` for the TikTok Shop is not `AD_PROMOTION`, you don't have management access to the TikTok Shop. Ask one admin for the Business Center to share the TikTok Shop with you and grant the TikTok Shop management access using [/bc/asset/assign/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739438211077121). The Business Center admin needs to specify `asset_type` as `TIKTOK_SHOP` and `store_role` as `AD_PROMOTION`.
  4. Ensure that you have operator or admin access to the ad account that you want to use to create GMV Max Campaigns. To do this, call [/bc/asset/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739432717798401) and set `asset_type` to `ADVERTISER`. 

If the returned `advertiser_role` for the ad account is not `OPERATOR` or `ADMIN`, you don't have operator or admin access to the ad account. Ask one admin for the Business Center to share the ad account with you and grant the operator or admin access using [/bc/asset/assign/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739438211077121). The Business Center admin needs to specify `asset_type` as `ADVERTISER` and `advertiser_role` as `ADMIN` or `OPERATOR`.
  
# Steps
## 1. Select a TikTok Shop and an ad account that are available for Product GMV Max Campaigns
**i. Obtain a TikTok Shop that is available for GMV Max Campaigns and ensure the ad account has GMV Max authorization for TikTok Shop.**

To do this, use [/gmv_max/store/list/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001044479041) and confirm that the returned `is_gmv_max_available` is `true` and the returned `advertiser_id` within `exclusive_authorized_advertiser_info` is the same as the ad account that you want to use to create GMV Max Campaigns.

If the returned `advertiser_id` is not the same as the ad account that you want to use to create GMV Max Campaigns, use [/gmv_max/exclusive_authorization/create/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001200356354) to grant the ad account exclusive GMV Max authorization for the TikTok Shop.

> **Important**

> 
- For each TikTok Shop, only one ad account can be authorized to create GMV Max Campaigns using the TikTok Shop for optimized revenue and sales campaigns.
- If you grant an ad account exclusive GMV Max authorization for the TikTok Shop, the previous ad account loses access to GMV Max Campaigns that use the same TikTok Shop, and all existing GMV Max Campaigns that use the same TikTok Shop in the previous ad account are automatically paused.

**ii. Confirm that the products are not occupied by an enabled Product GMV Max Campaign.**

Each product within a TikTok Shop can only be used in one enabled Product GMV Max Campaign at a time.
- For Product GMV Max Campaigns that promote all products within a TikTok Shop, ensure that the TikTok Shop is only used in one enabled Product GMV Max Campaign.
  - To confirm that no enabled Product GMV Max Campaigns use all products within a TikTok Shop, call [/gmv_max/store/shop_ad_usage_check/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001084174338) and check the returned `promote_all_products_allowed`.
  - If returned `promote_all_products_allowed` is `false`, you need to disable enabled Product GMV Max Campaigns using the same TikTok Shop. You can find these campaigns by using [/gmv_max/campaign/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1826463372290177). Set `gmv_max_promotion_types` to `["PRODUCT_GMV_MAX"]`, specify the ID of the TikTok Shop via `store_ids` , and set `primary_status` to `STATUS_DELIVERY_OK`. If you want to disable these campaigns, use [/campaign/status/update/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739320994354178) and set `operation_status` to `DISABLE`.
- For Product GMV Max Campaigns that promote specific products within a TikTok Shop, ensure that each product is only used in one enabled Product GMV Max Campaign. You can create more than one enabled Product GMV Max Campaign for the same TikTok Shop, as long as these campaigns promote different products.
  - To confirm that no enabled Product GMV Max Campaigns use specific products within a TikTok Shop, use [/store/product/get/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1793482248880130). Set `ad_creation_eligible` to `GMV_MAX` and check whether the returned `gmv_max_ads_status values` for the `item_group_id` of the products that you want to promote are `UNOCCUPIED`.
  
**iii. (Optional) Confirm that the TikTok Shop and the products within the TikTok Shop are not occupied by enabled [Video Shopping Ads](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1750361719059457) or [Product Shopping Ads](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1785886237030401).**

- Promoting all products from a TikTok Shop in a Product GMV Max Campaign will automatically pause or impact any existing enabled Video Shopping Ad Groups or Product Shopping Ad Groups using the same shop, regardless of which ad account the Video Shopping Ad Groups or Product Shopping Ad Groups were created in. 

If you want to promote all products from a TikTok Shop in a Product GMV Max Campaign, you can call [/gmv_max/store/shop_ad_usage_check/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001084174338) to confirm whether the TikTok Shop has existing enabled Video Shopping Ad Groups or Product Shopping Ad Groups. 

- Promoting specific products from a TikTok Shop in a Product GMV Max Campaign will automatically pause or impact any existing enabled Video Shopping Ads or Product Shopping Ads using the same products, regardless of which ad account the Video Shopping Ads or Product Shopping Ads were created in. 

If you want to promote specific products from a TikTok Shop in a Product GMV Max Campaign, call [/gmv_max/store/shop_ad_usage_check/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001084174338) to confirm whether the products have been occupied by existing enabled Video Shopping Ads or Product Shopping Ads. 
  - If the returned `is_running_custom_shop_ads` is `true`, you can call [/gmv_max/occupied_custom_shop_ads/list/](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1822001136924674) and set `occupied_asset_type` to `SPU` to find out the specific enabled Video Shopping Ads or Product Shopping Ads that are using these products.
