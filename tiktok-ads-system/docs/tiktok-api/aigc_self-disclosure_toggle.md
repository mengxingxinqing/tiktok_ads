The AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) self-disclosure toggle, also known as "This ad contains Al-generated content" setting, allows you to transparently disclose AI-generated content in your ads. Once you turn on the toggle for your ad, your ad will carry an "Advertiser labeled as Al-generated" label when users click the ad thumbnail in the TikTok search results page and view the ad in full. By turning on this toggle, you confirm that your content conforms to [our guidelines for Al-generated content](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-ads-policy-misleading-and-false-content?lang=en).

You can turn on the toggle exclusively for non-Spark Ads but not for Spark Ads. Spark Ads will use the "AI-generated" label instead and TikTok may apply the "AI-generated" label to Spark Ads content that is detected to be completely AI-generated or significantly edited by AI. This ensures appropriate labeling for AI-generated content in different types of ads.
