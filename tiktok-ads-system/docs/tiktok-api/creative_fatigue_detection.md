Creative Fatigue Detection is a feature that enables you to identify Creative Fatigue, which occurs when the performance of an ad starts declining due to repetitive or excessive exposure. With the Creative Fatigue Detection feature, you can actively monitor whether your ads have been repeatedly shown to the same audience. After a fatigued ad has been detected, you can optimize the performance of your ad campaign by adding new ads to the same ad group.

> **Note**

> Creative Fatigue Detection is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative.

## Considerations for detecting Creative Fatigue
Creative Fatigue Detection is performed by considering the following aspects:
- Declining performance:
  - The CPA (Cost Per Action) of the ad increases beyond a certain threshold.
  - The cost of the ad decreases below a certain threshold.
- Reduced reach to new audiences:
  - The number of new audiences reached by the ad is decreasing and is predicted to continue decreasing.
