## Creative-level metrics
These metrics show the basic attributes and performance for creatives within Product GMV Max Campaigns created on TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Seller Center. 

**Supported dimension groupings**

To retrieve creative-level metrics for Product GMV Max Campaigns, specify the following dimension grouping using the `dimensions` parameter:
- `["campaign_id","item_group_id","item_id"]`
- `["campaign_id","item_group_id","item_id","stat_time_day"]`
- `["item_id","stat_time_day"]`

> **Note**

> If you specify the dimension grouping `["campaign_id","item_group_id","item_id","stat_time_day"]`, the API returns only records with associated cost data. As an example, for a campaign with 100 creatives where just 20 generated costs, you will receive reporting data solely for those 20.

**Supported filters**

```xtable
| Filter field{25%} | Required/Optional/Conditional{15%} | Max size{20%} | Requirement{40%} |
|---|---|---|---|
| campaign_ids | Required   | 100 | Specify the ID of a Product GMV Max Campaign. 

 To obtain such an ID, use the dimension `campaign_id` to query [campaign-level metrics](#item-link-Campaign-level metrics (for Product GMV Max)) first. 

**Note**: When you filter multiple IDs using this field, you cannot retrieve [attribute metrics](#item-link-Attribute metrics).|
| item_group_ids | Required   | 100 |Specify the ID of an SPU used in the Product GMV Max Campaign. 

  To obtain such an ID, use the dimension `item_group_id` to query [product-level metrics](#item-link-Product-level metrics) first.  

**Note**: When you filter multiple IDs using this field, you cannot retrieve [attribute metrics](#item-link-Attribute metrics).|
| creative_types {-to-be-deprecated}  | Conditional| 1 |
- Required when you filter one SPU ID using `campaign_ids` and `item_group_ids`.
- Not supported when you specify multiple IDs in the `campaign_ids` filter or `item_group_ids` filter or both, or specify multiple ID dimensions.
Specify any of the following values:
- `ADS_AND_ORGANIC`: Ads and organic.
- `ORGANIC`: Organic only. 
- `REMOVED`: Removed. 
**Note**: This filter cannot be used together with `creative_delivery_statuses`.|
| creative_delivery_statuses | Optional | N/A |
- You can only use this filter in any of the following scenarios: When you specify multiple IDs in the `campaign_ids` filter or `item_group_ids` filter or both
- When you specify one ID in the `campaign_ids` filter or `item_group_ids` filter or both
- When you specify multiple ID dimensions
- This filter cannot be used together with `creative_types`.
Specify one or more of the following values:
- `IN_QUEUE`: In queue. Post is ready to be tested for its conversion-driving potential.
- `LEARNING`: Learning. Post is being tested for its conversion-driving potential.
- `DELIVERING`: Delivering. Post is being regularly promoted as part of your campaign.
- `NOT_DELIVERYING`: Not delivering. Post didn't show strong conversion potential during testing and will not be regularly promoted as part of your campaign.
- `AUTHORIZATION_NEEDED`: Authorization needed. This video hasn't been authorized for use in ads. You can authorize your own videos from your TikTok account or request authorization from other creators. This status will be updated here within 20 minutes of authorization.

- `UNAVAILABLE`: Unavailable. Private videos, rejected videos, deleted videos, or videos from suspended TikTok accounts can't be used in ads. In some cases, you may observe cost from unavailable videos because videos that are rejected by TikTok’s content review process part-way through the campaign may still be delivered.
- `REJECTED`: Rejected. The video has been rejected by the content moderation team. If you've appealed a rejection, the video status will be "rejected" until the appeal has been reviewed.
- `NOT_ACTIVE`: Not active. This post has been deprioritized because it was uploaded more than 30 days ago and hasn't earned any gross revenue in the past 30 days.|
| search_word | Optional |N/A | N/A |

## Duration-level metrics
These metrics show the basic attributes and performance for each duration of Product GMV Max Campaigns created on TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Seller Center. 
- If the optimization mode remained unchanged throughout the campaign, you will see a single record corresponding to the configured optimization mode.
- If the optimization mode was changed during the campaign, you will see multiple records, with each record corresponding to each optimization mode used.

For example, if you initially set the optimization mode to Target ROI and later switched to Maximum Delivery, you will receive two separate records: one for the period using Target ROI and another for Maximum Delivery.

**Supported dimension groupings**

To retrieve duration-level metrics for Product GMV Max Campaigns, specify any of the following dimension groupings using the `dimensions` parameter:
- `["duration"]`
- `["campaign_id","duration"]`
- `["item_group_id","duration"]`

## Duration-level metrics
These metrics show the basic attributes and performance for each duration of LIVE GMV Max Campaigns created on TikTok Ads Manager or TikTok Seller Center. 
- If the optimization mode remained unchanged throughout the campaign, you will see a single record corresponding to the configured optimization mode.
- If the optimization mode was changed during the campaign, you will see multiple records, with each record corresponding to each optimization mode used.

For example, if you initially set the optimization mode to Target ROI and later switched to Maximum Delivery, you will receive two separate records: one for the period using Target ROI and another for Maximum Delivery.

**Supported dimension groupings**

To retrieve duration-level metrics for LIVE GMV Max Campaigns, specify any of the following dimension groupings using the `dimensions` parameter:
- `["duration"]`
- `["campaign_id","duration"]`
- `["room_id","duration"]`
- `["campaign_id","room_id","duration"]`

**Supported filters**
```xtable
| Filter field{25%} | Required/Optional{15%} | Max size{20%} | Requirement{40%} |
|---|---|---|---|
| campaign_ids | Required | 100 | Specify the ID of a LIVE GMV Max Campaign. 

To obtain such an ID, use the dimension `campaign_id` to query [campaign-level metrics](#item-link-Campaign-level metrics (for LIVE GMV Max)) first.  

**Note**: When you filter multiple IDs using this field, you cannot retrieve [attribute metrics](#item-link-Attribute metrics).|
| room_ids | Required   | 100 |Specify the ID of a livestream room used in the LIVE GMV Max Campaign. 

To obtain such an ID, use the dimension room_id to query [livestream-level metrics](#item-link-Livestream-level metrics) first.  

**Note**: When you filter multiple IDs using this field, you cannot retrieve [attribute metrics](#item-link-Attribute metrics).|
