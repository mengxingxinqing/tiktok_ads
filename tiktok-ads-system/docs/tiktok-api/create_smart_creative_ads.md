Use this endpoint to create Smart Creative ads by uploading necessary ad creatives to the library. With this endpoint, you can upload multiple ad texts, titles, materials, and call-to-actions to the library. The platform automatically combines your ad creatives and prepares them for delivery. `ad_id` is not returned in the response. This is a totally new endpoint in v1.3.

> ACO ads are no longer supported in API. To ensure a smooth API integration, we recommend you migrate to [Smart Creative ads](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1767322784934914).

To obtain the actual accurate result, wait for 2 or 3 seconds after your call to the endpoint `/ad/aco/create/`and then use the endpoint [/ad/aco/get/]( https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739473020978177).|

## Ad name generation rules

* If a valid string is passed in to the `ad_name` field, and `file_name` in `image_info` or `video_info` is also passed in, then ad names will be generated in the format of "adName_" followed by sequence numbers, such as "adName_001".
* If a blank string is passed in to the `ad_name` field, and `file_name` in `image_info` or `video_info` is also passed in, then ad names will be generated in the format of "{file_name}_" followed by sequence numbers, for example, "image_001" or "video_002".
* If If a blank string is passed in to the `ad_name` field, but the `file_name` in `image_info` or `video_info` is not passed in, then ad names will be generated in the format of "_" followed by sequence numbers, for example, "_001". Try to avoid this case so that ad names can be more meaningful.
