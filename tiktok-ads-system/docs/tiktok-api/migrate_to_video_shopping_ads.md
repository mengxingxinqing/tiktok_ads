#  FAQs
**What happens to my existing campaigns?**
- Campaigns you've created with the previous objectives (Collection Ads or Dynamic Showcase Ads) will remain active and there is no need to make any changes to your existing campaigns. Advertisers will also be able to edit  your existing campaigns in TikTok Ads Manager till the end of March 2023. 

**My advertiser does not want to leverage Dynamic Showcase Ads anymore. Do we still have to do the migration?**
- If your client does not wish to use Dynamic Showcase Ads anymore, they do not need to migrate their campaigns and can leave it to sunset. However, should they change their mind after 'Catalog Sales' sunsets, we recommend that they test the new Video Shopping Ads flow to create a new campaign. 

**Will the platform automatically migrate existing Collection Ads or Dynamic Showcase Ads campaigns for my advertisers?**
- New Video Shopping Ads will not be automatically created for existing clients as Video Shopping Ads have a different setup flow and new features compared to Collection Ads or Dynamic Showcase Ads. See [Video Shopping Ads](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1741942291730434&rid=tv5sdeafqp) to find out the detailed creation steps via API.

**My advertiser is using Collection Ads on Reach and Video View objectives. Can they do the same on Video Shopping Ads?**
- Video Shopping Ads are best suited for optimization for pixel events (e.g. Purchase, Add to Cart, View Content) or traffic. Advertisers are recommended to leverage other branding objectives if they wish to achieve reach or views for their marketing campaigns.
