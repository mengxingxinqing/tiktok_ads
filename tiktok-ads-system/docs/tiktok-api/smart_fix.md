Smart Fix is a feature that helps you identify and fix video issues, such as video size and resolution, which could later get your ads disapproved or rejected during campaign creation process.

With Smart Fix enabled, we will automatically detect and fix the following issues in your video: 
* `LOW_RESOLUTION`: Video resolution rate is lower than 540x960px, which doesn't meet our requirements.
* `ILLEGAL_VIDEO_SIZE`: The video size is not correct.Please use the standard video size: Square (1:1)/Vertical (9:16)/Horizontal(16:9) .

Smart Fix API's function is two-fold:
- When uploading new videos, you can turn on Smart Fix.  We will conduct a pre-audit of your videos. Moreover, if we detect any of the issues mentioned previously, we will automatically perform a quick fix, so that the videos uploaded can be more compliant to TikTok's standards.
- For existing videos, we offer two new endpoints for you to create an audit task as well as retrieve the task result, enabling you to comprehensively check all your existing videos for potential issues.
