|---|---|---|
|Access-Token {Required}|string|Authorized access token. For details, see [Authentication](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738373164380162).|
```

**Parameters**

``` xtable
|Field{30%}|Data Type{15%}|Description{55%}|
|--- |--- |--- |
| advertiser_id {Required} | string | Advertiser ID. |
| targeting_type {Required} | string | The primary targeting type. 

Enum value: `INTEREST_AND_BEHAVIOR` (Interests & Behaviors). |
| sub_targeting_types {+Conditional} | string[] | Required when `targeting_type` is `INTEREST_AND_BEHAVIOR` and multiple keywords are passed to `search_keywords`. 

The secondary targeting types. 

Enum values: 
- `GENERAL_INTEREST`: general interests. 
- `ADDITIONAL_INTEREST`: additional interests. 
-  `PURCHASE_INTENTION`: purchase intention. 
-  `VIDEO_INTERACTION`: video interactions. 
- `CREATOR_INTERACTION`: creator interactions. 
- `HASHTAG_INTERACTION`: hashtag interactions. 

-  If `search_keywords` is not passed, the allowed values are `GENERAL_INTEREST`, `PURCHASE_INTENTION`, `VIDEO_INTERACTION`, `CREATOR_INTERACTION`, `HASHTAG_INTERACTION`. If you don't pass `sub_targeting_types` in such cases, the default value for `sub_targeting_types` will be ` ["GENERAL_INTEREST","PURCHASE_INTENTION","VIDEO_INTERACTION","CREATOR_INTERACTION","HASHTAG_INTERACTION"]`.
-  If `search_keywords` is passed and contains one single keyword, the allowed values are `GENERAL_INTEREST`, `ADDITIONAL_INTEREST`, `PURCHASE_INTENTION`, `VIDEO_INTERACTION`, `CREATOR_INTERACTION`, `HASHTAG_INTERACTION`.  If you don't pass `sub_targeting_types` in such cases, the default value for `sub_targeting_types` will be ` ["GENERAL_INTEREST","ADDITIONAL_INTEREST","PURCHASE_INTENTION","VIDEO_INTERACTION","CREATOR_INTERACTION","HASHTAG_INTERACTION"]`.
-  If `search_keywords` is passed and contains more than one keyword, the allowed values are `ADDITIONAL_INTEREST`, `HASHTAG_INTERACTION`. In such cases, you need to manually pass `sub_targeting_types`. |
| search_keywords | string[] | A list of seed keywords that you provide to search for targeting categories or hashtags. 

Max size: 10. The length limit for each keyword is 100 characters. 

If you pass multiple seed keywords to this field, ensure the value of `sub_targeting_types` includes only `ADDITIONAL_INTEREST` and `HASHTAG_INTERACTION`. 

**Note**: Searching for hashtag bundles is not supported. Therefore, if you include `HASHTAG_INTERACTION` in the value of `sub_targeting_types` and pass `search_keywords`, you can only get hashtags from the returned `search_result` within the `hashtag_interaction` object. To retrieve hashtag bundles, include `HASHTAG_INTERACTION` in the value of `sub_targeting_types` and do not pass `search_keywords`. |
| language | string | The language of the seed keywords. 

 Default value: `en`. 

To find the allowed values, see [List of values for `language`](#item-link-List of values for language). 

**Note**: If you include `HASHTAG_INTERACTION` in the value of `sub_targeting_types` and pass one or more non-English seed keywords to `search_keywords`, hashtags in multiple languages might be returned, even if you specify `language`. This is because searching for hashtags based on a single language is not supported and some characters or letters are shared among certain languages. |
| filtering | object | Filtering conditions. |
#| special_industries | string[] | Special ad categories. 
By selecting a housing, employment, or credit category for your campaign, you certify not to use TikTok to discriminate based on protected characteristics in ads relating to housing, employment, or credit and to adhere to [TikTok's special ad category policy](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/housing-employment-credit-hec-ad-policy?redirected=2).
