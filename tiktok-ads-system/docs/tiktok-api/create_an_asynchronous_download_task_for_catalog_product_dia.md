# Create an asynchronous download task for catalog product diagnostic information

**Doc ID**: 1771117279175682
**Path**: API Reference/Catalog Diagnostics/Create an asynchronous download task for catalog product diagnostic information

---

Use this endpoint to create an asynchronous download task for catalog product diagnostic information.

After the task is created, use [/diagnostic/catalog/product/task/get/](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1771117294731266) to download the resulting CSV file. Note that the diagnostic information provided by the asynchronous download task is less detailed than the synchronous catalog diagnostic information provided by the endpoint /diagnostic/catalog/. The asynchronous download task only returns the Product ID (`product_id`), SKU ID (`sku_id` / `hotel_id` / `flight_id` / `destination_id`), Item title (`title`), Issue title (`issue_title`), Severity (`issue_level`), and Source (feed name) for each issue.
