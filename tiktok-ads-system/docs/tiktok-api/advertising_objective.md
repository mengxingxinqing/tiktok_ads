Advertising objective refers to the business goals that you want your campaigns to achieve. For example, you want to use ads to get as many users interested in your business to visit your website or download your App. In the above cases, you can set your advertising objectives to `TRAFFIC` and `APP_PROMOTION` respectively.

Advertising objectives are set at the campaign level. 

> **Note**
You cannot modify an ad objective after it has been set.
