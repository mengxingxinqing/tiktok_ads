# Synchronous and asynchronous modes
You can run a report in synchronous mode or asynchronous mode. See [Synchronous and asynchronous reports](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1751088469160001) to learn about how to run a synchronous report or asynchronous report.  

# Ad type
You can run a report on your auction ads or both auction and reservation ads data.

# Report types
We provide six report types: basic report, audience report, playable ads report, Dynamic Showcase Ads(DSA) report, Business Center report, and GMV max ads report. See [Report types](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738864835805186) to find out different use cases. 

# Data level
- If the report is a Business Center report, you don't need to manually set the service type and data level. Business Center reports support both auctions and reservation ads.
- If the report is a Basic report, Audience report, Playable ad report, or DSA report, you can run a report at the campaign level, ad group level, ad level, or ad account level. 

**Below is the relationship between ad type, report type, and report data level for Basic report, Audience report, Playable ad report, and DSA report:**

- If the report is a  GMV max ads report, you can run a report at the campaign level or ad account level.

# Dimensions, metrics, and filters
Different report types support different dimensions, metrics, and filters. See corresponding articles under [Report types](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1738864835805186) to find out these dimensions, metrics, and filters.
